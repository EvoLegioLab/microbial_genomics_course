In this episode we will try to pinpoint single nucleotide variants or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) between our samples and the reference. The SNPs are determined by a process called read mapping in which they are aligned to the reference sequence.

The identified SNPs will be used to compare the isolates to each other and to establish a phylogenetic tree.

## Starting a new screen session

Again we will use a ‘screen session’ to do our calculation in the background. You can start a session and give it a descriptive name:

~~~
$ screen -S snp
~~~
{: .bash}

This creates a session with the name ‘snp’

As you work, this session will stay active until you close this session. Even if you disconnect from your machine, the jobs you start in this session will run till completion.

## SNP calling

[SNIPPY](https://github.com/tseemann/snippy) is a pipeline that contains different tools to determine SNPs in sequencing reads against a reference genome. It takes forward and reverse reads of paired-end sequences and aligns them against a reference. 

It is very fast but a single run of SNIPPY still takes about 10 to 12 minutes. We will therefore tell SNIPPY to run all the samples after each other. However this time we can not use a wildcard to do so. We will instead run all the samples in a loop.

~~~
$ cd ~/dc_workshop/data/trimmed_fastq/
$ for sample in ERR026473 ERR026474 ERR026478 ERR026481 ERR026482 ERR029206 ERR029207
>  do
>  snippy  --outdir ~/dc_workshop/results/snps/"${sample}" --ref ~/dc_workshop/data/GCF_000195955.2_ASM19595v2_genomic.fna --R1 "${sample}"_1.fastq_trim.fastq --R2 "${sample}"_2.fastq_trim.fastq
>  done
~~~
{: .bash}


**Detach session (process keeps running in background)**

You can detach from a session by pressing `control + a` followed by `d` (for detach) on your keyboard. 

You can now safely work on a different task or log out of your machine. The assembly will keep on running.



After the run is finished we can check the results.

$ head -n10 ~/dc_workshop/results/snps/ERR029207/snps.tab

{: .output} 

This list gives us information on every SNP that was found by SNIPPY when compared to the reference genome. The first SNP is found at the position 1849 of the reference genome, and is a C in the H37Rv and an A in isolate ERR029207. There is a high confidence associated with this SNP: an A has been found 225 times in the sequencing reads and never a C at this position.

## Core SNPs

In order to compare the identified SNPs with each other we need to know if a certain position exists in all isolates.
A core site can have the same nucleotide in every sample (monomorphic) or some samples can be different (polymorphic). 
SNIPPY will concatenate the core SNPs, i.e. ignoring sites that are monomorphic in all isolates and in the reference. Concatenation of the SNP sites reduces the size of the alignment considerably.

The '--noref' argument tells SNIPPY to exclude the reference from the alignment.  
The '--aformat' argument determines the alignment output format. We need a phylip format as input for our next tool.

$ cd ~/dc_workshop/results/snps/

Our output in phylip format was written to 'core.aln'. But let's have a look at the results.

## Phylogenetic tree  

Phylogenetic trees have been discussed during the lectures. We will here establish a phylogenetic tree 
from the file 'core.aln' with PhyML. PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood 
principle. Since the original [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14530136), PhyML has been widely used 
and cited. There is a range of parameters that need to be chosen, such as  nucleotide or amino-acid substitution model 
(see the [web-version of PhyML](http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/usersguide.php?type=command) but for simplicity we 
will run PhyML with standard parameters.

~~~
$ phyml -i core.aln
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
...
. Log likelihood of the current tree: -1807.238286.

. Compute fast branch supports on the most likely tree...

. Printing the most likely tree in file 'core.aln_phyml_tree.txt'...

. Time used 0h0m1s

oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
~~~
{: .output}

With this small data set, PhyML finishes very quickly. Let's put the resulting files into a separate folder 
and let's rename our resulting tree.

~~~

$ mkdir tree
$ mv core.aln_phyml_stats tree/
$ mv core.aln_phyml_tree tree/core_snps.newick
~~~
{: .bash}


Let's inspect our tree.

~~~
$ cd ~/dc_workshop/results/snps/
$ cd tree
$ head -n10 core_snps.newick
~~~
{: .bash}


~~~
(ERR026481:0.00000001,ERR026482:0.00767108,((ERR026473:0.31329695,ERR026474:0.26681667)0.921000:0.15635534,(ERR026478:0.00000012,(ERR029207:0.00000001,ERR029206:0.00504197)0.000000:0.00000001)1.000000:0.58688282)1.000000:0.41758464);
~~~
{: .output}

This does not look much like a tree yet. The tree is written in a bracket annotation, the [Newick format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format). In order to make sense of it we can better view this in a tree viewer. For this, we need to copy the core_snps.newick file to our own computer.


## Visualization of phylogenetic trees

We will be using [Dendroscope](http://dendroscope.org/) to view the phylogenetic tree established from the core SNPs. Dendroscope is a tree viewer which allows to edit the trees and zoom in and out.
